The moving average crossover strategy in moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py is a trend-following strategy that generates trading signals based on the relationship between two moving averages of different lengths.

### High-Level Concept

The core idea is that when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, it signals upward momentum and a potential buy signal. Conversely, when the shorter-term moving average crosses below the longer-term moving average, it signals downward momentum and a potential sell signal.

### How It Works in the Script

1.  **Calculate Moving Averages:** The script calculates two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) for the 'Adj Close' price:
    *   A "fast" (shorter-term) SMA using a window defined by the `fast_MA` variable.
    *   A "slow" (longer-term) SMA using a window defined by the `slow_MA` variable.

    ```python
    # filepath: c:\Users\hklov\OneDrive\Documentos\UToronto\aps1052\HomeworkPandasExercise_UPLOAD\moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py
    # ...existing code...
    dfP['SMA_fast'] = dfP['Adj Close'].rolling(window=fast_MA).mean()
    dfP['SMA_slow'] = dfP['Adj Close'].rolling(window=slow_MA).mean()
    # ...existing code...
    ```

2.  **Generate Trading Signals:** Boolean columns are created to identify crossover points:
    *   `long_entry`: True when the fast SMA is greater than the slow SMA.
    *   `long_exit`: True when the fast SMA is less than the slow SMA.
    *   `short_entry`: True when the fast SMA is less than the slow SMA (if `shorts` is enabled).
    *   `short_exit`: True when the fast SMA is greater than the slow SMA (if `shorts` is enabled).

    ```python
    # filepath: c:\Users\hklov\OneDrive\Documentos\UToronto\aps1052\HomeworkPandasExercise_UPLOAD\moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py
    # ...existing code...
    # set up num_units_long
    dfP['long_entry'] = ((dfP.SMA_fast > dfP.SMA_slow))
    dfP['long_exit'] = ((dfP.SMA_fast < dfP.SMA_slow))
    # ...existing code...
    # set up num units short
    dfP['short_entry'] = ((dfP.SMA_fast < dfP.SMA_slow))
    dfP['short_exit'] = ((dfP.SMA_fast > dfP.SMA_slow))
    # ...existing code...
    ```

3.  **Determine Position (`stance`):** The `long_entry`, `long_exit`, `short_entry`, and `short_exit` signals are used to determine the trading position (`num_units_long` and `num_units_short`). These columns are filled forward (`fillna(method='pad')`) to maintain the position until an exit signal occurs. The final `stance` column represents the overall position (e.g., 1 for long, -1 for short, 0 for flat).

    ```python
    # filepath: c:\Users\hklov\OneDrive\Documentos\UToronto\aps1052\HomeworkPandasExercise_UPLOAD\moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py
    # ...existing code...
    dfP.loc[dfP['long_entry'], 'num_units_long'] = 1
    dfP.loc[dfP['long_exit'], 'num_units_long'] = 0
    # ... (similar logic for short) ...
    dfP['num_units_long'] = dfP['num_units_long'].fillna(method='pad')
    # ... (similar logic for short) ...
    dfP['stance'] = dfP['num_units_long'] * \
        (1-tcost) + dfP['num_units_short']*shorts*(1-tcost)
    # ...existing code...
    ```

4.  **Calculate System Returns:** The `stance` column (representing the trading position) is multiplied by the daily percentage returns (`pct_rets`) of the asset, shifted by a `delay` period, to calculate the system's daily returns (`syst_rets`).

    ```python
    # filepath: c:\Users\hklov\OneDrive\Documentos\UToronto\aps1052\HomeworkPandasExercise_UPLOAD\moving_average_crossover_simple_incomplete.py
    # ...existing code...
    dfP['pct_rets'] = (dfP['Adj Close']-dfP['Adj Close'].shift(1)
                       )/dfP['Adj Close'].shift(1)
    dfP['syst_rets'] = dfP['pct_rets'] * dfP['stance'].shift(delay)
    # ...existing code...
    ```

### In Summary

The script calculates two moving averages, uses their crossover points to define entry and exit signals for long and short positions, translates these signals into a trading `stance`, and finally calculates the returns generated by following this `stance` based on the asset's price movements.

This strategy is simple but can suffer from lag (signals appear after a trend is established) and whipsaws (false signals in choppy markets).
