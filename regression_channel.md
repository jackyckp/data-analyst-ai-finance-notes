The **Regression Channel** in RegressionChannelSimple.py is used to identify the trend and potential reversal points by fitting a linear regression line to price data and creating parallel channel lines above and below it.

### How It Works (with Example Code)

1. **Fit a Linear Regression Line**  
   The regression line represents the trend of the price over a rolling window.

   ````python
   # filepath: c:\Users\hklov\OneDrive\Documentos\UToronto\aps1052\HomeworkPandasExercise_UPLOAD\RegressionChannelSimple.py
   # ...existing code...
   window = 100  # window size for regression
   dfP['regression_line'] = dfP['Adj Close'].rolling(window).apply(
       lambda x: np.polyval(np.polyfit(range(window), x, 1), window-1)
   )
   # ...existing code...
   ````

2. **Calculate Standard Deviation of Residuals**  
   This measures how far prices deviate from the regression line.

   ````python
   # ...existing code...
   dfP['regression_resid'] = dfP['Adj Close'] - dfP['regression_line']
   dfP['regression_std'] = dfP['regression_resid'].rolling(window).std()
   # ...existing code...
   ````

3. **Create Channel Lines**  
   The upper and lower channel lines are set a certain number of standard deviations above and below the regression line.

   ````python
   # ...existing code...
   num_std = 2  # number of standard deviations for the channel
   dfP['upper_channel'] = dfP['regression_line'] + num_std * dfP['regression_std']
   dfP['lower_channel'] = dfP['regression_line'] - num_std * dfP['regression_std']
   # ...existing code...
   ````

4. **Trading Signal Example**  
   You can generate signals when price crosses the channel boundaries.

   ````python
   # ...existing code...
   dfP['signal'] = 0
   dfP.loc[dfP['Adj Close'] > dfP['upper_channel'], 'signal'] = -1  # Sell signal
   dfP.loc[dfP['Adj Close'] < dfP['lower_channel'], 'signal'] = 1   # Buy signal
   # ...existing code...
   ````

### Summary

- The regression channel helps visualize the trend and volatility.
- Signals are generated when prices move outside the channel, suggesting potential reversals.
- The code above demonstrates the typical steps: fit regression, calculate deviation, build channels, and generate signals.

**Gotcha:**  
Make sure your rolling window is large enough to capture the trend but not so large that it lags behind price changes. Also, ensure you handle NaN values at the start of the series due to rolling calculations.
